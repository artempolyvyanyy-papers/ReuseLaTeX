\begin{ncdefine}{Information model}{def:data:model}{\quad\\}
An \emph{information model} is a 4-tuple $(E,R,\rho,\Psi)$, where:
\begin{compactitem}
\item
$E \subseteq \powerset{\identities}$ is a finite set of \emph{entity types};
\item
$R \subseteq \labels$ is a finite set of \emph{relation types};
\item
$\rho : R \rightarrow \kleenestar{E}$ is a \emph{relation definition function} that maps every relation type onto a finite sequence of entity types 
for which it holds that for every $e \in E$ there exists $r \in R$, called the \emph{entity relation} of $e$, such that $\rho(r)=\sequence{e}$; and
\item
$\Psi$ is a collection of \emph{constraints} defined as a formal theory of the first-order logic statements over 
a collection of predicates that for every $r \in R$ contains a predicate with the domain $\prod_{i=1}^{|\rho(r)|}{\rho(r)(i)}$.
